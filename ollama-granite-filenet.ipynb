       "## Understanding the Error\n",
       "\n",
       "The error code **FNRAC1001W** with the message *\"Server trace logging is enabled\"* indicates that server trace logging has been activated. Trace logging is typically used for debugging purposes, allowing administrators to capture detailed information about system operations and potential issues.\n",
       "\n",
       "For a junior administrator, this means:\n",
       "- The system's performance might be impacted because capturing extensive logs can slow down processes.\n",
       "- There could be disk space concerns as log files grow over time if not managed properly.\n",
       "- It may lead to security or compliance issues since sensitive data could inadvertently be recorded in the logs.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Common Scenario\n",
       "\n",
       "Imagine a scenario where an administrator has been troubleshooting intermittent application crashes and, during this process, accidentally left server trace logging enabled. A few days later, they receive notifications that storage is running low on disk space due to the large volume of log files generated.\n",
       "\n",
       "In another case, the finance team might be experiencing slow performance when adding new invoices into the system because the extensive logs are consuming resources needed for efficient operation.\n",

       "## Step-by-Step Troubleshooting\n",
       "\n",
       "### First Actionable Step: Verify Current Logging Status\n",
       "1. **How-to**: Log in to the IBM FileNet Content Engine Administration Console (ACCE) and navigate to *Server > System Properties*.\n",
       "2. **Why it's important**: Checking the current logging status helps you confirm whether server trace logs are indeed enabled, which directly addresses the error at hand.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Second Actionable Step: Review Server Logs\n",
       "1. **How-to**: Access the server log files typically located in `<install_directory>/logs/p8_server_error.log`.\n",
       "2. **What to look for**: Search for keywords such as `\"TRACE\"`, `\"LOGGING\"`, or any entries that indicate verbose logging is active.\n",
       "3. **Why it's important**: Reviewing these logs will provide insight into what processes were being logged and might reveal if there are other issues besides trace logging.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Third Actionable Step: Adjust Logging Configuration\n",
       "1. **How-to**:\n",
       "   - In ACCE, go to *Server > System Properties*.\n",
       "   - Locate the property related to logging (e.g., `P8_TRACE_LEVEL`).\n",
       "   - Set this property to a lower level such as `ERROR` or `WARN`, depending on your needs for diagnostic information without excessive detail.\n",
       "2. **Why it's important**: Adjusting the logging configuration helps reduce unnecessary data collection, freeing up system resources and addressing performance issues.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Summary of Solutions\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Revert Logging Level**: Change server trace logs back to a less verbose level like `ERROR` or `WARN`. This will help maintain necessary diagnostic capabilities without overloading system resources.\n",
       "- **Monitor Disk Space Regularly**: Implement regular monitoring for disk space usage related to log files to prevent storage issues from impacting operations.\n",
       "- **Review Log Policies**: Establish clear policies regarding when and how long server trace logging should be enabled. Ensure that it is disabled after troubleshooting unless explicitly needed.\n",
       "\n",
